YOLO Application - Explanation
Introduction
The YOLO (You Only Look Once) Application is an e-commerce platform that incorporates the YOLO algorithm for object detection. It is designed to provide users with the ability to upload images, perform object detection using YOLO, and visualize the detected objects in the uploaded images. This explanation document provides a detailed overview of the YOLO application, its features, technologies used, installation steps, configuration options, usage instructions, and acknowledgements.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images to the YOLO application for object detection.
Object Detection: The YOLO algorithm is employed to perform object detection on the uploaded images.
Object Visualization: Detected objects in the uploaded images are displayed for visualization.
Technologies Used
The YOLO application utilizes the following technologies:

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Object Detection: YOLO Algorithm
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes
Declarative Files: YAML
Installation
To install and run the YOLO application, follow these steps:

Install minikube on your local machine.
Clone the repository from the provided IP address using the command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/yolo-app.git
Install all the necessary dependencies.
Build the Docker images individually for each component.
Start the application.
Create the deployment, service, configuration, and PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) YAML files.
Deploy the application on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) and access the external IP from the services.
Configuration
The backend of the YOLO application can be configured using the following environment variables:

MONGODB_URI: The URI for connecting to the MongoDB database.
NODE_ENV: The environment mode (e.g., development, production).
To configure these variables, create a .env file in the backend directory and set the desired values.

Usage
Once the YOLO application is up and running, you can perform the following actions:

Access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Access the backend database in your browser at http://localhost:5000.
Try adding an item for object detection using the provided features.
The backend database uses MongoDB Atlas. You can replace the connection string with your own if desired.
